                <h5 class="fancy_title">The beginnings</h5>
                <p>Hangman was first whispered into existence during a stormy night in the 18th century, when a group of 
                    sailors found themselves stranded on a desolate island. To stave off the creeping despair, 
                    they invented a word game to challenge their wits and pass the time. Using a stick to draw in the sand, 
                    one sailor would think of a word while the others guessed letters. With every wrong guess, they drew part 
                    of a stick-figure man hanging from a gallows—a grim nod to the superstitions of sailors about the dangers 
                    of their trade. The game became a distraction, a shared battle of minds where the stakes were both dire 
                    and thrilling, as each wrong guess seemed to mirror their tenuous grip on survival.</p>

                <h5 class="fancy_title">Evolution</h5>
                <p>Over centuries, Hangman evolved from those crude beginnings into a game of intrigue and strategy, 
                    finding its way into schoolyards, parlors, and even the digital world. In this fictional reimagining, 
                    it gained unexpected notoriety as a secret training tool for cryptographers during the early 20th century. 
                    Hidden behind the guise of a children’s game, it was said to sharpen pattern recognition and lateral 
                    thinking—essential skills for breaking codes. The government’s best puzzle-solvers spent countless hours 
                    decoding complex phrases under the guise of harmless Hangman tournaments. Though its origins remain murky, 
                    Hangman has endured as a testament to humanity’s ability to turn even the darkest of symbols into a 
                    celebration of creativity and cleverness.</p>
